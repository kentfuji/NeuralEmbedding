# Neural Implicit Embedding for Point Cloud Analysis

This is the author's simple implementation of the CVPR 2020 paper:
 [Paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Fujiwara_Neural_Implicit_Embedding_for_Point_Cloud_Analysis_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) 

## Overview
We present a novel representation for point clouds that encapsulates the local characteristics of the underlying structure. 

The key idea is to embed an implicit representation of the point cloud, namely the distance field, into neural networks.

 ## Requirements

The code requires the following:
* Python 3.6
* Keras 2.3
* CUDA 10.1
* cudnn 7
* cupy
* threading

## Usage

To run the code, simply run
```
python classify.py
```
to conduct classification on ModelNet 40 dataset. Please download the [data](https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/media/modelnet40_ply_hdf5_2048.zip), and modify the DATA_DIR and SAVE_DIR to the preferred locations. As the code creates various intermediate files based on original file names, please modify both train_files.txt and test_files.txt to only include file names without the directory or the extension, e.g. just 'ply_data_train0' 

and run
```
python segment.py
```
to conduct segmentation on ShapeNet Parts dataset. Please download the [data](https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/ericyi/shapenetcore_partanno_v0.zip) and do the same as above.

Preprocessing data into ELM requires memory space. We recommend splitting the data files into smaller batches if the processing fails.
